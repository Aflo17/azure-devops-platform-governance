Azure DevOps Platform Assessment &amp; Governance Enablement

# Azure DevOps Platform Assessment & Governance Enablement (Lab)

## Scenario (Fictional Client)
**Northwind Health** is a mid-size healthcare SaaS company that scaled rapidly from 2 to 8 delivery teams. Azure DevOps usage grew organically with inconsistent workflows, ad-hoc pipelines, and unreliable reporting. Leadership cannot trust delivery metrics, and teams are spending time on rework caused by inconsistent processes.

## Project Goal
Simulate an Azure DevOps platform consulting engagement:
1. Assess current-state Azure DevOps configuration, usage, and governance
2. Identify scalability, consistency, and reporting risks
3. Present improvement options with tradeoffs and select an intentional target state
4. Implement approved configuration changes (boards, repos, pipelines)
5. Improve data quality at the source through standards and validation
6. Leave the platform supportable with documentation, runbooks, and contract-exit handoff guidance

## What This Repo Contains
- `docs/` — assessment, findings, options/tradeoffs, and handoff documentation
- `ado-config/` — platform standards for boards, repos, and pipelines
- `pipelines/` — reusable pipeline templates and a sample implementation
- `dashboards/` — reporting query definitions and dashboard design

## Success Criteria
- Clear current-state vs improved-state Azure DevOps understanding
- Intentional, documented platform decisions
- Reduced rework and reporting friction through standards and validation
- Clear ownership and next steps at contract exit
