## Work Item Inventory
- Total work items: 8
- Epics: 2
- Issues: 6
- Tasks: 0

## Data Quality Findings (Evidence-Based)
- Items missing Area Path (default/root): **5**
- Items missing Iteration Path: **8**
- Items missing description or acceptance details: **7**
- Items with vague or non-descriptive titles: **5**

Examples observed:
- Issue titles such as "Fix issue", "Cleanup", and "Improve system" do not clearly communicate scope or intent.
- Tags are inconsistently applied (urgent, misc, comp, backend), limiting their usefulness for reporting or filtering.
- Ownership is unclear due to inconsistent Area Path usage.

## Process Observation
The project is currently using the **Basic process**, which provides limited work item differentiation. Combined with inconsistent usage patterns, this reduces clarity between feature work, operational tasks, and strategic initiatives.

## Impact Assessment
### Reporting Risk
Inconsistent Area and Iteration data prevents accurate sprint and ownership reporting.

### Consistency Risk
Teams are interpreting and using work items differently, increasing friction and rework.

### Scalability Risk
As additional teams onboard, these issues will compound without enforced standards or validation.
